# Pythonista-AWSIcons

This isn't extremely useful for Pythonista users; however it will service as an example of using some of the photos library functionality.

Note: This will *only* work in 

## What it does it do?

A class which provides the following examples:
* List albums
* Create a new album (checks for existing album)
* Add image to album
* Add bulk images to album
    * This adds the images individually so that I can give a progress update using Pythonista's ui
    * Images can either be a Pythonista Asset or a file
    * Checks for file existence
* Abundance of exception handling
* Commented
    * Sphinx comments will be done later, I've been changing my mind a lot on this

## Why do it? Why on github?

Good Question - I did this because I am using the mobile app [Flowdia Diagrams](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flowdia-diagrams/id1170864140?mt=8). It doesn't (to my knowledge) 

I've uploaded it to github in order to share.
